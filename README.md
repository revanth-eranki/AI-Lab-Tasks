# AI-Lab-Tasks  

This repository contains implementations of key Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and techniques, developed as part of my AI lab coursework. Each task demonstrates the application of fundamental AI concepts in problem-solving.  

## Implemented Algorithms  

### Search Algorithms  
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph or tree.  
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search):** Expands the least-cost node first.  
- **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search):** Combines BFS and DFS features with a depth limit increment.  
- **A* Search:** Finds the least-cost path using a heuristic function.  

### Optimization and Local Search Techniques  
- **Simulated Annealing:** Solves optimization problems by simulating the cooling process of metals.  
- **Genetic algorithm:** Solves optimization problems using principles of natural selection and genetics.  

### Game Search Algorithms  
- **Adversarial Search (Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning):** Implements decision-making in a two-player competitive environment.  

### Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)  
- Solves problems like n-Queens, and map coloring using backtracking and heuristics.  

### Propositional Logic and Satisfiability  
- **DPLL Algorithm:** Solves SAT problems using backtracking and pruning techniques.  

### Bayesian Networks and Probabilistic Reasoning  
- **Inference Methods:** Includes MLE, MAP, Gibbs Sampling, Likelihood Weighting, and Rejection Sampling for probabilistic inference.
